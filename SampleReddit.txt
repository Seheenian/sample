I've placed over a dozen orders with them and really like them! Lots of shipping options and usually the cheapest ones out there too. My experience is based on having things shipped to the US so I don't know if that will make a difference.

I've never had any trouble with them, they ship fast, and the albums always come packaged really well. I live in Brazil, and the first time I ordered an kpop album from another website 4 years ago my album got lost so I switched pretty fast. Ktown4u seemed reliable so I tried it and it was pretty good so I've been ordering albuns from them ever since.

I really like them since they have more shipping options than most of the sites and their prices are pretty good too. Also the shipping is really fast even for the cheapest options, for me (I live in Europe) it takes usually about a week to two.

The only problem I've ever had when the album I ordered was out of stock but they didn't tell it till I reached out to them asking why hasn't my order still been shipped. Got my money back immediately and otherwise they've been great!
